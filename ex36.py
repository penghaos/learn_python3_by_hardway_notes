# Rules for if-statements:

''' 1. Every IF-STATEMENT mush have an ELSE.
2. If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function
in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. 
This will find many errors.
3. Never nest if-statement more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
4. Treat if-statement like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences.
Put blank lines before and after.
5. Your Boolean should be simple.If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your 
function and use a good name for the variable.

Rules for Loops

'''
1. Use a WHILE-LOOP only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to Python;
other languages are different.  
while-loop一般用来无限循环 loop forever。
2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things too loop over.
 有限个数的number时，可以用for-loop
